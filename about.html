      <h2>One might wonder how Tetris, a degree in Sociology, and a love of shoes lead me to become
      UX Designer…</h2>
      <br>
      <p>When I was quite young I was the best at Tetris. Better than all the boys and better than all 
      the girls. I was obsessed with it, much to their chagrin, they wanted to move on and do something 
      else - but I needed to beat it. The thing is you can’t beat Tetris, but I learned a few lessons 
      that have stuck, one technology isn’t just for boys, and two if you try hard enough you can figure 
      anything out.</p>
      <br>
      <p>College was a meandering path that led me to a degree in Sociology. I loved learning how people tick, 
      but psychology wasn’t quite right. I took some art classes but chose to pursue fiber arts on my own 
      (I still weave to this day.) In the late 90’s computer science and graphic design existed, but they 
      didn’t connect yet. I noticed I was gravitating toward two different areas: research, I loved 
      statistics as much as the field research, and Sociology, I was fascinated by how humans form a 
      society and react to it on both macro and micro levels.</p>
      <br>
      <p>At the age of 24, I opened my own shoe store. I did everything from branding and identity, buying and 
      visual merchandising, hiring and training, and budgeting. I created an open space with open sight 
      lines, a calming, fresh, color scheme, and obsessive organization. Everything was as easy and as 
      transparent as it could be. I was able to watch how everyone interacted with each part of the process 
      and was able to tweak it as needed. After a few years of iteration and a move, everything was just as 
      I needed it to be and I had the time to create our website. Using Shopify I was able to use one of 
      their templates, which (queue the Tetris brain) I worked obsessively on, but I was always struggling 
      with the limitations and started looking into how templates are created and… *lightbulb* I discovered 
      UX Design. The more I read about UX Design the more I realized that I have been doing this both physically 
      and digitally for my entire adult life. Spot a pain point, do research, develop a solution, test it on 
      users.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After 15 years, I decided to get out of the shoe business while the getting was good, so after over a 
    year of thought, and with our lease renewal looming, I closed the store and started a UX Design 
    apprenticeship at Bloc. It felt like this is what I have been training for my whole life. I’m so 
    excited to create digital items that flow as well as SHÜ. So far my favorite part of UX is that there 
    is never an end to information, new technologies, diving into user experience from a new angle, or 
      learning a new program or a language.</p>
