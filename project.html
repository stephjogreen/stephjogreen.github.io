        <h4>Strategy</h4>
        <p> Create a cloud storage application geared toward a profession,
          that shares and stores files with a built in organizational system,
          featuring a pinboard style social media feed. <br>
          The field I chose to gear the applications toward was architecture.
          There is a need in that profession to share and organize large files,
          which can also serve as a place to connect with clients.

        <h4>Future Considerations</h4>
        <p>Hatch in its current state is a minimally viable product. If the product
        was developed I would implement the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Version control</li>
          <li>Document security</li>
          <li>Direct linking to relevent design software</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="conclusion">
      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
      <p>Since Hatch was my first full scale project I grew by leaps and bounds,
       but there were three key revelations that struck me during this project. <br>First,
       minimalism is harder to appropriately apply than I had initially thought, and
       thoughful design is key. <br>Next I realized there is a danger that when you are overly familiar
       with a product, expecially if you created it, to assume user knowledge and create
       confusion. <br>Additionally I leared to seek feeback constantly and aggressively. Testing
       each process, each flow, each design decision, will help keep the needs of the
       user forefront.</p>
